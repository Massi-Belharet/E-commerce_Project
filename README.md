# E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis Project  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes e-commerce customer behavior data to derive actionable insights using machine learning techniques. We combine clustering (K-means) and classification (ID3 Decision Tree) to understand customer segments and predict their behaviors.  

## Objectives  

### 1. Customer Segmentation (Using K-means Clustering)  
- Group customers based on similar behavioral patterns.  
- Identify distinct customer segments based on:  
  - Purchase behavior: Total spend, average order value, and category diversity.  
  - Transactional patterns: Return rate, total items purchased, and average items per order.  
  - Customer attributes: Age and spend variability.  

### 2. Predictive Analysis (Using ID3 Decision Tree)  
- Predict customer churn probability for each segment.  
- Identify key factors influencing:  
  - Customer retention.  
  - Purchase behavior.  
  - Product returns.  

## Expected Outcomes  
- Detailed customer segment profiles based on clustering.  
- A churn prediction model with interpretable decision rules.  
- Actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.  
- Identification of customer behavior patterns and risk factors for churn.  

## Why ID3 Decision Tree?  
I chose the ID3 Decision Tree because I studied it in my courses and wanted to apply my knowledge in a real-world scenario. While more advanced models might perform better, this was an opportunity to reinforce my understanding of decision trees and entropy-based classification.  

This project serves as both a practical application of my learning and an exploration of customer behavior analysis using machine learning.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- imblearn (SMOTE) (Handling Data Imbalance)
